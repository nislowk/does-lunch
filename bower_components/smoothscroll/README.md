smoothscroll.js
=================

Polyfill for
* window.scroll(x, y, ScrollOptions);
* window.scrollTo(x, y, ScrollOptions);
* window.scrollBy(x, y, ScrollOptions);

* element.scrollIntoView(toTop, ScrollOptions); (incomplete)

Usage
-----

This depends upon `requestAnimationFrame`. As such you can use either
dist/smoothscroll.js if you have a raf polyfill already included (or are
supporting only raf-enabled browsers), or use dist/smoothscroll.raf.js
to use a version bundled with a polyfill (batteries included version).
